This is the Amity department Store application. It could not be launched due to college policies against student businesses but it is complete and runs flawlessly.
This project was done by Aadesh Rana and Gaurav Jayasawal from Amity University Haryana.

```Java
package sajha.com.sajha;

import android.os.Bundle;
import android.support.annotation.NonNull;
import android.support.annotation.Nullable;
import android.support.v4.app.Fragment;
import android.view.LayoutInflater;
import android.view.View;
import android.view.ViewGroup;

import com.stepstone.stepper.Step;
import com.stepstone.stepper.VerificationError;

public class Form1 extends Fragment implements Step {

    @Nullable
    @Override
    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, @Nullable ViewGroup container, @Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.economic_help, container, false);
        return view;

    }
}
